* generic operations with explicit dispatch
** new types
*** assign a type tag
*** write new methods
*** modify generic methods to take into account the new type
** new operations
*** add new operations for each type
*** define generic procedure (explicitly write dispatch code for each procedure)

* data directed
** new types
*** assign a type tag
*** write package for new type
** new operations
*** add procedures to existing packages
*** assign procedure to lookup table
*** define generic procedure

* message passing
** new types
*** create new constructor
** new operations
*** add new operations to each constructor
*** define generic procedure

* Slightly easier to create new types with message passing, new operations with data directed
